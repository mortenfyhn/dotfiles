# Global Claude Instructions

## Environment

- Framework 13 AMD laptop
- Fedora 42
- Firefox
- Zsh

## Code guidelines

- Only implement what has been explicitly requested or discussed. Do not expand scope, add extra features, or handle additional corner cases without asking first.
- Always prefer solutions that require minimal code changes or remove code entirely.
- Comments, commit messages etc should mainly explain the WHY.
