# Global Claude Instructions

These instructions apply to all repositories and projects.

## Scope Management

**IMPORTANT**: Only implement what has been explicitly requested or discussed. Do NOT expand scope, add extra features, or handle additional corner cases without asking first.

- If you think it would be beneficial to expand scope or handle more cases, **ASK the user first** before implementing
- Do not implement "nice to have" features that weren't requested
- This avoids wasting time having to pare down over-engineered solutions
- When in doubt, implement the minimal solution that addresses the specific request
